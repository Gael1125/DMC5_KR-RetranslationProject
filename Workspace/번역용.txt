앞으로 이런 '거머리'들을 자주 보게 될 텐데,<lf>


Whatever sorcery it was that cooked up the original Black Angel, somebody's been mighty busy perfectin' it to make this fella.

Retractable shields built into both arms?
It's attack and defense in a single package!
And with that demon gal Trish stuck inside, it could blast lightning all up in your face too.
Lemme tell ya, I've got a lot of respect for the design!

Sure wish I coulda seen this one myself, but I guess I'll have to quiz Trish and Dante about it instead...
